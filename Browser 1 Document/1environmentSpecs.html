<!-- Pay attention to the words: In parallel to PARSING THE PAGE -->

<!-- The defer attribute is a boolean attribute. -->
<!-- If the defer attribute is set, it specifies that
 the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page,
 and executed after the page has finished parsing.

Note: The defer attribute is only for external scripts
 (should only be used if the src attribute is present). -->
