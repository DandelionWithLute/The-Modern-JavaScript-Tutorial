// To hide an internal interface we use either protected or private properties:

// Protected fields start with _. Thatâ€™s a well-known convention, not enforced at the language level. Programmers should only access a field starting with _ from its class and classes inheriting from it.
// Private fields start with #. JavaScript makes sure we can only access those from inside the class.
// Right now, private fields are not well-supported among browsers, but can be polyfilled.
